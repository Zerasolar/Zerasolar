##Definitions

What is a class?
What I think is it is where you could put methods that can be use only for the class in there to access. It can contain a method, class variable and a instance variable declarations, but as before they are only called for that class. Unless you created a module because their methods can work for over several classes.

What is a model?
I believe it is same as a class just a different name. Though if you are building a web application you create a model folder to hold those classes.

What is a method?
Methods are a block of code that are bound to some object and have access to its instance variables.

What is a variable?
It is what you delared and assigned values to. For example a = 14. Though through some reading I found out in Ruby that it's variable is different compare to some code. Since Ruby is a dynamically type language it has a couple key advantages. Unlike Java or C you don't have to declare a type when creating a variable. Instead Ruby looks at the type of value you are assigning to the variable and dynamically works out the variable type. Because of this you can change the variable type later in your code unlike Java or C where that stays the same.

What is a request?
Whatever the user is asked from the web application you built.

What is a route?
Well for a route...well I thinking 192.168.ect ect that your website might sit on. From there it's the inquiry to the user and the path that goes and the user request that same route back to your website.

In the context of a web application, what is a "response"?
Well it's with the gets "/home" do. The part where the user is able to click and the website response to that. For a little better example is where a website is responsive to the size of the screen and movement of the mouse to know what choices the user might make.
